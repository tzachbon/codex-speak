# Subscription speech-to-text

The same module serves Python callers and other apps on this Windows PC.
It uses the existing Codex ChatGPT login, with no OpenAI API key. Audio goes
to Codex's remote realtime service. The HTTP listener itself is localhost only.

## Run the server from the tray app

Turn on **Settings → Speech-to-text → Run the speech-to-text server**. The app then
serves on port 18765 whenever it runs, and the URL stays the same after restarts, so
OpenWhispr keeps working. The manual command below is for running without the tray app.

## Run the server manually

From this project's directory:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m codex_speak.stt_server
```

The default port is 18765. Binding fails if another service already owns it.
Keep that process running. Ctrl+C stops accepting requests and waits for active
transcription to finish. It does not install a service or start automatically.

Open `%LOCALAPPDATA%\codex-speak\stt-connection.json` and copy `base_url` into
OpenWhispr's **Speech-to-Text → Self-Hosted → Server URL**. Set **Model** to
`codex-realtime` (or leave it empty). No API key is needed in that panel.

The URL includes a random local access token. It changes each time the server
starts, so recopy it after a restart. Keep the connection file private. The
server removes its connection file on normal shutdown and does not log URLs,
recordings, or transcripts. `--port` and `--connection-file` can override defaults.

## Internal Python use

```python
from pathlib import Path
from codex_speak.stt import transcribe

# Blocking call: run in a worker thread, not the GUI thread.
text = transcribe(Path("recording.webm").read_bytes())
```

There is no microphone capture or new UI in the existing TTS app. The module is
ready for its callers to supply a recording.

## HTTP contract

- `GET {base_url}/models` lists `codex-realtime`, a local adapter name, not a selectable OpenAI model.
- `POST {base_url}/audio/transcriptions` takes multipart `file`, optional `model`,
  `language`, `prompt`, and `response_format` (`json` or `text`).
- Default response: `{"text": "transcribed words"}`. Other formats and fields
  are rejected. `language` and `prompt` are advisory hints, not verified controls
  over the input-transcription engine.
- WAV, WebM, Ogg, MP3, MP4/M4A, and FLAC are decoded in memory. Maximum encoded
  audio: 25 MiB. Maximum decoded duration: 60 seconds. One transcription at a time.
- Busy requests receive 429. Bad audio/form fields receive 400, oversized HTTP
  uploads 413, backend failures 502, and backend timeouts 504.
- Backend failures add `error.code` (for example `no_transcript`, `connection_failed`,
  `backend_start_failed`, `unknown`) and `error.request_id`. Messages never include
  backend exception text, and only startup failures suggest checking the Codex login.
- Each transcription call (including invalid-input and busy rejections) appends one metadata line to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\codex-speak\stt-diagnostics.log`
  (rotated at 1 MiB): request ID, outcome code, failing stage, stage timings, event-type
  counts, and the audio duration Codex reported receiving. No audio, text, or URLs.
  `no_transcript` with a low `server_audio_ms` means Codex did not ingest the audio.
- Native requests and Electron's `Origin: null` are accepted only with the private
  URL and a local Host header. Arbitrary browser origins are rejected.

This matches [OpenWhispr's documented self-hosted request format](https://github.com/OpenWhispr/openwhispr/blob/main/examples/custom-asr-shim/README.md).
An actual OpenWhispr dictation session is a separate acceptance check.

## Limits and verification

This is experimental Codex WebRTC v3, tested with Codex 0.160.1.

Audio is sent 4 times faster than real time. Codex then keeps transcribing for a
while (about 10 s after sending a 23 s clip). English and Hebrew synthetic clips
stayed at 0% word errors and finished about 9 s sooner than a 1x send.
Mixed Hebrew/English accuracy varied widely at both speeds, so whether 4x
changes it is inconclusive.

Codex sends no whole-recording final signal (its user turn often never closes).
Each transcript fragment carries its position in the audio. The adapter returns
once at least 2.5 s have passed since sending finished and no fragment arrived for
2 s plus the audio Codex has not yet transcribed, plus 1 s for clock skew (Codex
positions ran about 0.6 s ahead of the sent audio in testing). That gives a late
word the time it would have had at 1x. The untranscribed allowance is capped at
the time saved by sending ahead (0.75 × clip length), which is also used when a
position is more than 1 s past the end. With no fragments at all it returns
2.5 s + 0.75 × clip length after sending finished. The hard cap is
12 s + 0.75 × clip length. The 2 s and 2.5 s limits are
about twice the worst case measured on 8 synthetic EN/HE/mixed runs sent at 1x
(last word 1.2 s after the audio, 1.1 s between words).
A slower Codex reply can still lose final words. Do not use it for long
recordings or as a guaranteed verbatim transcription service.

Codex sometimes does not take in the audio at all (`no_transcript` or
`session_closed` with `server_audio_ms` 0). This was seen at both speeds.

The original synthetic English probe had 0% word errors. Mixed Hebrew/English
had 33%, including unwanted transliteration. Real microphone/noisy speech is
not validated. There is no silent fallback to a different provider.

Run deterministic checks:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_stt.py -v
```

Explicit live HTTP check, using the existing synthetic English fixture under
`spikes/out` (consumes subscription usage):

```powershell
$env:STT_LIVE_CHECK = '1'
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_stt.py -v
Remove-Item Env:\STT_LIVE_CHECK
```

The live check encodes the fixture as WebM, uploads it over HTTP, and compares
the returned transcript to the reference only after receiving the result.
